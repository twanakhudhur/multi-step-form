# Multi-Step Form

A multi-step form built with React, TypeScript, Framer Motion, and React Hook Form
Project created as a part of Buena's Frontend Challenge.

### [live demo](https://multistepform-challenge.netlify.app/)


## üöÄ Features
**Multi-Step Navigation:** Navigate through multiple steps with validation on each step.

**Smooth Transitions:** Animated transitions between steps using Framer Motion.

**Validation:** Form validation powered by React Hook Form and Zod.

**Progress Indicator:** A progress bar shows the user's current step and form completion state.

**Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS to work seamlessly across devices.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
**React :** For building the user interface.

**TypeScript :** Ensures type safety.

**React Hook Form :** For efficient form handling.

**Zod :** Schema validation for form inputs.

**Framer Motion :** For animations and transitions.

**Tailwind CSS :** For fast and responsive styling.

**Vite :** For quick development builds and smooth workflow.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/twanakhudhur/multi-step-form.git

## üìù Key Functionalities
**Step Navigation:**
Each form step is validated before proceeding to the next step. If validation fails, the user cannot proceed.

**Animated Transitions:**
Transitions between steps are animated for a smooth user experience, thanks to Framer Motion.

**Form Validation:**
Validation is done on the client side using React Hook Form and Zod for schema-based validation. This ensures that the input data is valid before submission.

**Progress Bar:**
A visual progress bar helps the user understand how far they are in the form completion process.
